# Real Estate Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of real estate sales data. The analysis is performed using Python and various data science libraries. The primary aim is to explore trends in real estate sales, focusing on cumulative sales amounts and their year-on-year and month-on-month changes. While the notebook includes a few key graphs for visualization, readers should note that additional graphs could be created using similar methodologies. These are omitted in this analysis for brevity, as they would be variants of the provided graphs.

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries for data processing and visualization:
- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis tool.
- `numpy`: Essential for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Used for static data visualization.
- `plotly`: Provides capabilities for interactive and dynamic visualizations.
